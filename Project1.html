                    This website aims to connect like-minded individuals, eager to share their favorite
                    titles and authors via anonymous trading.
                    To get started, check out the "How it Works" section.

                    <h4><ins>About Us:</ins></h4>
                    <p>
                        Bunch's Book Trade started as a passion project of mine. Since the time I learned how,
                        I've always loved to read. I'm also a firm believer that variety is the
                        spice of life. I love meeting new people and partaking in new experiences.
                        So, I came to the conclusion that one of the best ways to steep myself
                        in the variety of life is to experience the stories that my peers love the most.
                        So, I started asking people: "What's your favorite book?" I would read whatever they
                        answered with. While I didn't enjoy every book at first, I could at least appreciate why
                        my classmates and coworkers did themselves. The best part was the conversations the
                        endeavor led to.
                        Eventually, though, I ran out of peers to ask and moved to online forums. From there,
                        the progression to standalone website was all but inevitable. Today, I still partake
                        in trading and reading these books, gaining more appreciation for every new
                        experience along the way. I hope you find as much joy and wonder as I have
                        connecting with people through these works.

                    <p>
                        Here at Bunch's Book Trade, we like to give you options. <br>
                        The easiest way to get involved is this: Donate any book -- preferably, your favorite book --
                        by mail or at one of our drop-off locations (<em>See our "Donate" tab</em> ).
                        By default, donations made will be accepted as just that: donations.
                        If you wish to receive a book in return, follow these instructions:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Include a message with your donation indicating you'd like to join our trade program. <br>(Physical note by mail, digital note when donating online.)</li>
                            <li>Allow 3-5 business days for us to contact you with confirmation of receiving your donation.</li>
                            <li>Once we contact you, confirm your name and address so we can add you to our trade system. <br>This is also the time to tell
                            us your book preferences.</li>
                            <li>Allow 10-15 business days to receive your new book.</li>
                            <li>Enjoy your new book for as long as you like -- we'll keep track of the details.</li>
                            <li>When you're done with your book, notify us online. We'll provide instructions
                                to <br> send it back so that you can receive a new one!
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    That's it! Our trade system is powered entirely by your donations. Feel free to send as many
                    books as you like, repeating the same process if you'd like to receive a book for each donation.
                    Currently, we limit members to 10 books in circulation at a time.
